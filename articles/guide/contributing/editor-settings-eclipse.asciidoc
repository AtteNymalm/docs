= Eclipse Editor Settings

This page describes the noticeable changes made to the default code formatting settings in Eclipse. 
This is also a chance to review some of these changes to validate or tweak them if necessary. 
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help. 
They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

== General

- Line length is 80 characters
- Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Use unix-style line endings (`\n`)

== Code Conventions

. Open menu:Window[Preferences] (Windows) or menu:Eclipse[Preferences] (Mac)
. On the menu:Java[Code Style > Formatter] page, import your local copy of link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/eclipse/VaadinJavaConventions.xml[VaadinJavaConventions.xml]
. On the menu:Java[Code Style > Organize Imports] page, import your local copy of link:https://github.com/vaadin/flow/blob/master/eclipse/flow.importorder[flow.importorder]
. On the menu:Editor[Save Actions] tab, make sure that in case _Format source code_ is active, the _Format edited lines option_ is selected. 
Never use the _Format all lines_ option, as that may introduce loads of unnecessary code changes, making code reviews a nightmare!
. Go to menu:General[Workspace]
.. Set _Text file encoding_ to *UTF-8*
.. Set _New text file line delimiter_ to *Unix*
. Go to menu:XML[XML Files > Editor] and ensure the settings are configured as follows:
- _Line width_: *72*
- _Format comments_: *true*
- _Join lines_: *true*
- _Insert whitespace before closing empty end-tags_: *true*
- _Indent using spaces_: *true*
- _Indentation size_: *4*
