[[designer.getting-started]]
= Getting Started

Vaadin Designer works projects using Vaadin Framework 8. In short, create a new
project as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/getting-started/getting-started-first-project#getting-started.overview,"Creating a Vaadin Project">>.

[[designer.getting-started.design]]
== Creating a Design

With your project selected, create a new design:

* In Eclipse select "File > New > Other", choose
[guilabel]#Vaadin 8 Design# from the list, and click [guibutton]#Next#.

* In IntelliJ IDEA select "File > New", choose [guilabel]#Vaadin 8 Design# from the list

In the design parameters step, make sure the locations are correct. You
can put the design in a specific package if you wish.

Give your design a descriptive name. Using a naming convention to separate the
design's companion Java file from the classes using it will make things easier
for you later.

For example, the name [classname]#UserEditorDesign# will result in
[filename]#UserEditorDesign.html# and [filename]#UserEditorDesign.java#. You
could then create a [classname]#UserEditor# component that extends the
[classname]#UserEditorDesign#, and perhaps a [classname]#UserEditorView# to
place the editor component in a bigger context.

In another case, you could make a [classname]#LoginDesign# that is used in a
[classname]#LoginWindow# (but not extended).

Finally, you can choose a template as starting point, or start from scratch
(Blank).

Choose [guibutton]#Finish# to create the design and open Vaadin Designer.


[[designer.getting-started.gui]]
== Vaadin Designer GUI Overview

Vaadin Designer is fully integrated with the IDE and its views can therefore be
freely moved and arranged as you wish. However, it is best to first try the
Designer in its default setup.
In Eclipse, this can be done by choosing [guibutton]#Show perspective# from the
dialog that is presented when a new design is created.

To be able to successfully use the Designer, you will need the Outline, Palette
and Properties views, in addition to the main editor.

The elements of the perspective illustrated in
<<figure.designer.getting-started.gui>> are as follows:

. Design files
. Editor (see below for close-up)
. Component palette
. Outline - component hierarchy
. Properties for the selected component

In the editor view, illustrated in <<figure.designer.getting-started.editor>>,
you have a number of controls in the toolbar.
