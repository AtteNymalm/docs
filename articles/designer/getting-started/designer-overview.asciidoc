Vaadin Designer is a visual WYSIWYG tool for creating Vaadin UIs and views by
using drag&amp;drop and direct manipulation. With features such as live external
preview and a strong connection between the HTML and the
Java code, it allows you to design and layout your UIs with speed and
confidence.

Vaadin Designer works with both Vaadin 10 designs and Vaadin Framework 8
designs. Check the Framework 8 documentation for more information about
designs and their declarative format.

Vaadin Designer is used to create a HTML file that defines a
UI, or part of a UI. Such a HTML file is called a __design__.

For a design, Vaadin Designer can create and update a Java file known as the
__companion file__. The companion file exposes elements of the
design to Java and provides a way to bind data between Java and the UI defined
in the design.

A design can be the whole UI or (more commonly) a smaller part of the UI, such
as a view or its sub-component. A UI or view can contain many designs.
