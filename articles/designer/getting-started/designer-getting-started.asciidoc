= Getting Started

Vaadin Designer works with projects using Vaadin Flow.
You can get started with a Flow project with these instructions: https://vaadin.com/start

[[designer.getting-started.design]]
== Creating a Vaadin 10+ design

With your project selected, find [guilabel]#Vaadin 10+ design# from the new file menu of your IDE.

[[figure.designer.getting-started.design.new]]
.Creating a New Vaadin 10+ design in Eclipse

In the next step, make sure the locations are correct.
The design file must be placed into the _frontend_ folder or one of its sub-folders.
You can also choose to create a Java companion file together with the new design.
The companion file can be located under any of the project's Java source roots.

[[figure.designer.getting-started.design.parameters]]
.New Design Parameters

Give your design a descriptive name. The name must be a valid
https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#valid-custom-element-name[HTML Custom Element name].

For example, the name _[classname]#user-editor-design#_ will result in
_[filename]#user-editor-design.js#_ and _[filename]#UserEditorDesign.java#_.

Choose [guibutton]#Finish# to create the design.

NOTE: Your project includes a number of UI components that are downloaded and installed when the project is built.
Designer needs those components to render the views. If you have not yet built or run the project,
Designer will install the components for you.

.Installing UI components

Vaadin Designer opens the new empty Design.
You can choose to start with a pre-made view template,
or by dropping a component from the palette to the designated area on the paper.

[[designer.getting-started.gui]]
== Vaadin Designer GUI Overview

[[figure.designer.getting-started.gui]]
.Panels in Vaadin Designer

The elements of the Vaadin Designer are as follows:

. Companion file
. Design file
. Editor (see below for close-up)
. Palette for web components, HTML elements and snippets
. Outline - component hierarchy
. Properties for the selected component

In the editor view, illustrated in <<figure.designer.getting-started.editor>>,
you have a number of controls in the toolbar.

[[figure.designer.getting-started.editor]]
.Component Editor
image::images/designer-3-getting-started-editor-toolbar.png[]

. Center viewport
. Viewport size and presets
. Rotate viewport (portrait / landscape)
. Send feedback
. Design mode
. Source mode
. Preview mode
. Companion file connector
. External preview

IMPORTANT: By default, Vaadin Designer requires Polymer dependency to render the whole viewport. Therefore, your project must have [guilable]#Polymer# dependency.

[[designer.palette]]
=== The Palette

The Palette appears on the right side of the editor. The Palette contains the web components available for the current design.
Users can drag a component from the Palette and drop it into the desired locations.

When a design is opened, the Designer searches the entire project for web components and loads them into the Palette.

[[figure.designer.palette.overview]]
.The Palette

There are 4 main groups of components: Patterns, Project Components, Components and Parts.

==== Patterns
This group contains quick-start solutions to certain design tasks.

==== Project Components
This group contains the designs from the project so that you can easily reuse them in the currently edited design.

==== Components
This group contains https://vaadin.com/components/[Vaadin Components] with example content and styles
so that you can quickly see how they work.

==== Parts
This group contains two sections: Web Components and HTML Elements.

==== Web Components
This group contains web components that are included in the project as https://www.npmjs.com/[`npm` dependencies].

==== HTML Elements
This group contains Native HTML5 elements, such as _style, h1 to h6, div, li, ol, p, ul, a, span, img, script, col, table, button, form, input, label, slot_ and _template_.
If you want to add inner text for an HTML element, you can drag and drop the `text` item from this group to the target element.

TIP: Make sure to run `mvn package` before opening your project.
Otherwise, web components are not added into the Palette and your project will not work properly.

==== How the "Project Components" scanning actually works
Whenever you open a Vaadin 10+ design, Vaadin Designer will scan the whole project for you.
All JavaScript files with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define[custom element definition] and extends https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/registering-elements[`PolymerElement`] will be considered as web components and end up in "Parts / Web Components" section.

If your project has a large number of components, the Palette [guilable]#Search field# can help you to find elements quickly.

[[figure.designer.palette.statusbar]]
.Palette shows the filtered components

If dependencies for items in _Patterns_ and _Components_ groups are missing,
an info indicator appears on each such item. You can hover over it to see more details.

.Missing dependency in Palette items

[[designer.outline]]
=== The Outline

The Outline is shown on top-right corner, containing the hierarchy of the opened design.
You can drag and drop components from the Palette to the Outline and create your design's structure.

A Vaadin 10+ design can have many root elements. +
Layout elements, such as _div, vaadin-form-layout, vaadin-split-layout, vaadin-horizontal-layout_ and _vaadin-vertical-layout_,
have their width and height expanded to 100% when they are roots.

Inside the Outline, you can also drag and drop a component around to re-arrange it,
or press kbd:[Delete] to remove a selected component.

[[figure.designer.palette.outline]]

[[designer.properties]]
=== The Properties

The Properties panel is located under the Outline, showing properties of the selected component.
[[figure.designer.properties.panel]]
.The Properties panel
image::images/designer-3-properties-panel.png[]

Relevant properties are grouped together in separate categories.
Only categories relevant to the selected component are shown.

==== Attributes Category
HTML attributes of the selected component are shown in this category.
You can add new attributes by clicking on the _Add attribute_ button ([guibutton]#+#) in the category header.

==== Flex Item Category
The flex item category is shown when the selected component is a child in a flex container.

==== Flex Container Category
The flex container category is shown when the selected component is a flex container;
either vaadin-vertical-layout, vaadin-horizontal-layout,
or a HTML element with `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` in its `style` attribute.
